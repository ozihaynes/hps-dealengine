# Knobs & Sandbox Mapping — HPS DealEngine

> Placeholder: populate with the authoritative mapping from sandbox/posture knobs to engine fields, trace frames, and UI cards.

- For now, refer to `docs/knobs-audit-v1.md` and sandbox preset docs for knob inventories and intended behaviors.
- Align with Analyze contracts, trace frames, and domain policies when filling this out so AI and devs know which knobs drive spreads, timeline, repairs, and risk gates.

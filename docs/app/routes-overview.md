# App Routes Overview — HPS DealEngine

> Placeholder: add the detailed route matrix (purpose, required context, primary KPIs, typical personas, and guard/redirect rules). Until filled, use `docs/app/underwrite-flow.md`, `docs/app/repairs-flow.md`, `docs/app/overview-layout-map.md`, and lifecycle docs for navigation intent.
